# JustJoinIT Job Market Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes job market data from JustJoinIT to uncover key employment trends, high-demand skills, salary ranges, and work arrangements. The goal is to provide actionable insights for education centers and professionals looking to align their skills with industry needs.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- **PySpark** â€“ For processing and transforming large JSON datasets.
- **Power BI** â€“ For interactive data visualization and KPI analysis.
- **Kaggle** â€“ Environment used for data preprocessing.
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ For structured analysis and data manipulation.

## ðŸ“Š Data Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned and standardized with the following key transformations:
- **Skills Extraction:** Parsed and consolidated job skill data into separate columns (`skill_1`, `skill_2`, `skill_3`).
- **Employment Type Categorization:** Mapped different job contracts (permanent, B2B, contract mandate) to salary ranges.
- **Location Normalization:** Standardized job listings for better geographical analysis.
- **Missing Data Handling:** Used logical placeholders (e.g., `"Unknown"`) instead of dropping incomplete records.

## ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard & Visualizations
An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to showcase:
1. **Job Posting Trends** â€“ Line chart tracking job postings over time by top companies (e.g., Nokia, 7N, XTB).
2. **Job Location Distribution** â€“ Map visualizing job postings across multiple countries (Poland, UK, France, etc.).
3. **Salary Analysis** â€“ Bar plots showing salary distribution by company.
4. **In-Demand Skills** â€“ Heatmap of the most frequently required skills.
5. **Work Arrangement Trends** â€“ Breakdown of remote, hybrid, and on-site jobs.
